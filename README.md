# Bubble-Sort
Bubble Sort is an inefficient sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through an array, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order, causing the largest elements to "bubble up" to their correct positions with each pass. This process continues until the array is fully sorted.
